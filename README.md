A dotNET assembly editor based on dnlib.

All kind of help from all sources is greatly appreciated. Feel free to upgrade, fix touch or hack
this project by submitting a pull request and I will make sure to merge it as soon as possible.

##Upper credits:
 - WiCKY Hu (Simple Assembly Explorer) for his awesome piece of work. Many ideas and features that
 you find in dnEditor are first seen there.
 - 0xd4d (dnlib) for the epic library that made this project possible.
 - yck1509 (dnSpy) for the first dnlib-based assembly decompiler. That definitely served me as a
 reference and dictionary of all I wasn't sure how to do.
