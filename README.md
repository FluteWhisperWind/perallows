dnEditor
========

A dotNET assembly editor based on dnlib.

All kind of help from any sources is greatly appreciated. Feel free to upgrade, fix touch or hack
this project by submitting a pull request and I will make sure to approve and merge it.

Please note that I am working on this project during my free time, and as just a teenager doing all
alone, I cannot do everything at will. If your favourite feature is not found in dnEditor - submit
a ticket. And just wait. I will eventually get through it.

#####Cheers!

#To-do:

##Credits:
 - WiCKY Hu (Simple Assembly Explorer) for his awesome piece of work. I took many ideas and features
 from there, for which I hope I won't be accused.
 - 0xd4d (dnlib) for the epic library that made this project possible.
 - yck1509 (dnSpy) for the first dnlib-based assembly decompiler. That definitely served me as a
 reference and dictionary of all I wasn't sure how to do.
 - Sebastien LEBRETON (Reflexil) for the currently only fully-working and fully-featured assembly
 editor. If you find something similar in dnEditor's design: it's either Reflexil that inspired me
 or Reflexil that made me use the (almost) same design.
 
####All licenses can be found in the LICENSES.md file in this (the root) folder.
