##Upper credits:
 - WiCKY Hu (Simple Assembly Explorer) for his awesome piece of work. I took many ideas and features
 from there, for which I hope I won't be accused.
 - 0xd4d (dnlib) for the epic library that made this project possible.
 - yck1509 (dnSpy) for the first dnlib-based assembly decompiler. That definitely served me as a
 reference and dictionary of all I wasn't sure how to do.
 - Sebastien LEBRETON (Reflexil) for the currently only fully-working and fully-featured assembly
 editor. If you find something similar in dnEditor's design: it's Reflexil that inspired(?) me.
